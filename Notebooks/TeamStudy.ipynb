    "# Team Analysis\n",
    "==========================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thinking\n",
    "* Players on better teams will play with better players and therefore will perform better\n",
    "    * Opponents will not be able to focus in on one specific player\n",
    "* Playing on a team with good defense will only for more offensive snaps\n",
    "* A good team plays to its strengths: good players will get the ball more\n",
    "    * Having a smart offensive coordinator or head coach that has a playbook that involves their best players is ideal\n",
    "* However, a good team may simply just have good players\n",
    "    * This means that sometimes, your player will perform well regardless of team: they are simply effective \n",
    "    * In addition, there is only one ball: stats cannot be shared\n",
    "        * Playing on a poor team would allow one great player to take in all the stats\n",
    "    * Does playing on a good team improve or decrease your fantasy production?\n",
    "    * In reality, this would mainly apply to teams with multiple superstars\n",
    "   \n",
    "==========================================================================================\n",
    "### Data Collection\n",
    "* Data is available from 2016-2021 (2022, but I don't want to include that data)\n",
    "* Players have their stats available in this same time period, but advanced stats and defensive aren't tracked until 2018\n",
    "    * Therefore, I will exclude looking at advanced stats in general in the first bit\n",
    "    \n",
    "==========================================================================================\n",
    "### Method of Analysis\n",
    "##### Numbers:\n",
    "* Will calculate the difference of a player's draft position and final standing and its \n",
    "    * For example: a player with an ADP (Average Draft Position) of RB12 but finishes the year as the RB5 would be +7\n",
    "        * Flipping the ADP and Finish would be a -7 rating\n",
    "        * However, finishing at RB5 from ADP12 is more important than finishing RB24 from ADP31\n",
    "            * The gap in points is simply too large\n",
    "            \n",
    "##### Cleaning + Preparing\n",
    "* Bring in the data and store in pandas dataframes\n",
    "    * Need to bring in:\n",
    "        * ADP (2016-2021Just Overall)\n",
    "        * Final Seasonal Numbers\n",
    "        * RedZone Passing, Receiving, Rushing\n",
    "        * TeamOffense:\n",
    "            * Conversions\n",
    "            * Drive averages\n",
    "            * Passing Offense\n",
    "            * Rushing Offense\n",
    "            * Scoring Offense\n",
    "* Create a Hashing System to link up team names with their abreviations\n",
    "* Link up player data (Player Team -> Team scoring/passing/receiving/rushing)\n",
    "* Divide up players by position for comparison\n",
    "* Scale the numbers (for SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Clustering\n",
    "* Graph a couple of seemingly import attributes\n",
    "* See if KMeans or MeanShift can cluster the data into groups, may take a long time\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Modeling\n",
    "* Will use a SVM and DecisionTree (Maybe RandomForest) to see if there is any trends\n",
    "* Test on 2022 Seasonal Data while training on these 5-6 years"
